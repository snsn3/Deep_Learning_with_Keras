# Deep Learning with Keras
This was done as part of a course I completed on using Deep Learning using Keras. The course is offered by IBM through Skills Networks and Coursera.

#Use Keras to build a NN
I use Keras to build a neural network with the following:
1. One hidden layer of 10 nodes, and a ReLU activation function.
2. The adam optimizer and the mean squared error as the loss function.
